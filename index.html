        <h2>About Saga Weaver AI</h2>
        <p>Saga Weaver AI is an AI designed to help you out with all of your Dungeons and Dragons needs. It will help you with everything from creating a character, keeping track of stats, creating a world, and remembering players stats to helping with leveling up your characters, making that a seamless process, and, when your players inevitably throw the entire campaign of the rails, help get it back on track based off of information that you have given it to build stuff off of.</p>

            <p>This AI is built to help players with all of their needs when playing Dungeons and Dragons. It is designed to work with a Character Sheet page and update the information on there as you play and give it prompts on what has happened in the campaign. You prompt it that you level up, it helps you through that process and updates the page. You prompt it that you took damage, it updates it for you! It also will help you in the character creation step of the game, something that can be very tedious to a lot of players.</p>

            <p>This AI is built to help the Dungeon Master with their needs while running the world that they have created. It will help them to build the world, making sure that all details are full of fun and care for the players to explore. If the players attack a random character, it will help come up with a stat block on the fly with only a simple prompt. Did the players do something completely unexpected and throw your entire campaign plan out the window? No need to worry! Saga Weaver AI will help create a flow of actions that will lead the players back on track without them noticing!</p>
